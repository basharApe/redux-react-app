I used  Create React App to initialize the project

For this project, I used those libraries below
React
React-dom
React-router-dom
React-scripts
React-redux
Redux
Redux-form
Redux-thunk
Lodash
Styled-components

For Grid and Modals and Input elements, I used Ant design instead of bootstrap.
I also add eslint and redux-devtools-extension

To run the project
First, you need to run npm install then npm start

Best regards,
